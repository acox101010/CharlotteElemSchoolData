# CharlotteElemSchoolData
This repository is a project I put together to analyze elementary schools near the uptown Charlotte area.</br>
Official data from ncpublicschools.org was utilized as well as demographics taken from schooldigger.com</br>
Hopefully this will help a parent determine the proper elementary school for their child within the uptown area.
